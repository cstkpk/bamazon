# Bamazon!

* The Bamazon app is an Amazon-like storefront that takes in orders from customers and accepts orders from managers and supervisors. Customers can view products for sale and purchase products; managers can view products for sale, view products with a low inventory, add inventory, and add new products; and supervisors can view product sales by department and create new departments. All of these changes are reflected in real time via the MySQL database.

* Once you start up the app, inquirer will use prompts to guide you through all possible functions.

* This is a CLI app that uses JavaScript, Node, Inquirer, Columnify, and MySQL.
